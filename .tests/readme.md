 - Uses output from [FF4EncounterFinder](https://simbu95.github.io/FF4EncounterFinder/).
  - Expected contains tables from the above tool
  - Actual contains tables generated by the encounter finding logic in this tool
  - Each row is plotted from left to right to fill the table for 70 generate steps on the above tool.
 - Plotting the same table using the same conditions in this tool should give the same (or equivalent) set of results for encounter information.
 - For tests that are marked as "verbose" these set `verbose_mode` to true on the overlay node
   - This will disable the behavior (in this tool) where if multiple encounters all give the same goal, then they are folded together into a "?"
 - Some tests have differences that are ok:
   - FF4EncounterFinder might not sometimes list the encounters even with encounter data turned on - so you will still see a "?" there
   - FF4EncounterFinder might not list encounters with 4 subsequent encounters (with the settings used for the expected tests)
   - Some formations might be sorted in a different order, and therefore given a different letter
 - Some tests have differences that are an inconsistency, but is ok after manual testing:
   - The encounter data from Rosa (which this tool uses) and FF4EncounterFinder are inconsistent for Mysidia. This can be seen in the verbose mac-giant & dmachin examples.
     - This is due to the encounter tables disagreeing between the Rosa and FF4EncounterFinder. In one there is an extra `Imp x6` encounter and the other has a `Needler x2 Sword Rat x2` 
     - I manually got into this encounter in FF4FE and indeed you do get a mac giant fight with the encounters this tool suggests - probably just a mistake in the other encounter finder!
